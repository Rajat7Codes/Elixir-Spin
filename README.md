# Elixir-Spin
Elixir Spin is a React-based mini-game for Clash Royale fans.
You can filter cards, toggle special categories (like 🧬 Evolutions, 🏰 Buildings, 💣 Big Spells),
and spin for random decks — just like pulling cards from a magical chest.

It’s built purely for fun and creativity, helping streamers, casual players, and fans experiment with deck ideas.
