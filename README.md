# Elixir Spin

**Elixir Spin** is a React-based mini-game and utility tool for **Clash Royale** fans.

It lets you filter cards, toggle special categories (such as 🧬 Evolutions, 🏰 Buildings, and 💣 Big Spells),  
and generate random decks using **Spin Wheels**, **Slot Machines**, and **Instant Randomizers** —  
similar to pulling cards from a magical chest.

Built purely for fun and creativity, Elixir Spin helps **streamers, casual players, and fans**
experiment with deck ideas and create entertaining challenges.
